Using **Materialize CSS**, I have created this page to showcase some of the projects I have worked on.
The projects are displayed in a carousel component (and are touch responsive if viewing on mobile).

The site is mobile-responsive and all links open in new tabs. The links will take you to my LinkedIn profile, my github profile, 
and to the deployed sites of the respective project you choose.

Also, attached is a _rough_ draft of my resume.

There is still a lot of work to do to improve it, and the more I learn throughout this coding bootcamp and on my own, the more I can implement.

Thanks for stopping by.
