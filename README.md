Using **Materialize CSS**, I have created this page to showcase some of the projects I have worked on.
The projects are displayed in a collapsible component and are expanded or minimized upon selection.

The site is mobile-responsive and all links open in new tabs. The links will take you to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub profile and to the deployed sites of the respective project you choose.

Thanks for stopping by.
